## Overview

This repository is a ZbotRL project based on Isaac Lab. It forks from [isaac-sim/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate), which allows us to develop in an isolated environment, outside of the core Isaac Lab repository.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/setup/installation/index.html). We recommend using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone the repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crowznl/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate.git
```

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```bash
python -m pip install -e exts/Zbot
```

- Verify that the extension is correctly installed by running the following command, to print all the available environments in the extension:

```bash
python scripts/tools/list_envs.py
```

<summary>Set up IDE (Optional, click to expand)</summary>

To setup the IDE, please follow these instructions:

- Run VSCode Tasks, by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, selecting `Tasks: Run Task` and running the `setup_python_env` in the drop down menu. When running this task, you will be prompted to add the absolute path to your Isaac Sim installation.

If everything executes correctly, it should create a file .python.env in the `.vscode` directory. The file contains the python paths to all the extensions provided by Isaac Sim and Omniverse. This helps in indexing all the python modules for intelligent suggestions while writing code.

<summary>Setup as Omniverse Extension (Optional, click to expand)</summary>

We provide an example UI extension that will load upon enabling your extension defined in `exts/Zbot/Zbot/ui_extension_example.py`. For more information on UI extensions, enable and check out the source code of the `omni.isaac.ui_template` extension and refer to the introduction on [Isaac Sim Workflows 1.2.3. GUI](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/introductory_tutorials/tutorial_intro_workflows.html#gui).

To enable your extension, follow these steps:

1. **Add the search path of your repository** to the extension manager:
    - Navigate to the extension manager using `Window` -> `Extensions`.
    - Click on the **Hamburger Icon** (☰), then go to `Settings`.
    - In the `Extension Search Paths`, enter the absolute path to `IsaacLabExtensionTemplate/exts`
    - If not already present, in the `Extension Search Paths`, enter the path that leads to Isaac Lab's extension directory directory (`IsaacLab/source/extensions`)
    - Click on the **Hamburger Icon** (☰), then click `Refresh`.

2. **Search and enable your extension**:
    - Find your extension under the `Third Party` category.
    - Toggle it to enable your extension.

## Tensorboard

To view tensorboard, run:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=your_logs
# or
python -m tensorboard --logdir=your_logs
```

## Code formatting

A pre-commit template is given to automatically format the code.

To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then you can run pre-commit with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pylance Missing Indexing of Extensions

In some VsCode versions, the indexing of part of the extensions is missing. In this case, add the path to your extension in `.vscode/settings.json` under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`.

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "<path-to-ext-repo>/exts/Zbot"
    ]
}
```

### Pylance Crash

If you encounter a crash in `pylance`, it is probable that too many files are indexed and you run out of memory.
A possible solution is to exclude some of omniverse packages that are not used in your project.
To do so, modify `.vscode/settings.json` and comment out packages under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`
Some examples of packages that can likely be excluded are:

```json
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.anim.*"         // Animation packages
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.kit.*"          // Kit UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.graph.*"        // Graph UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.services.*"     // Services tools
...
```
